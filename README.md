# Rick's Galactic Estate

## Credits
- This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- All content and imagery displayed on this website contents are copyright to their respective owners - Warner Bros. Television Distribution.

## Preface
I was interested in using React to build a website. Since  I was tasked to build a Real Estate page selling Planets I though why not incoporate a [Rick and Morty](http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/wiki/Rickipedia) theme.

## Features moving forward
- Use the Fandom Wikia API and build REST queries to pull the content dynamically from http://rickandmorty.wikia.com/api/v1/#!/Search
- Price range filters to assist with user interaction
